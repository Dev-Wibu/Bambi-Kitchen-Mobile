# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Login Issue & Workaround

**Currently using Mock Authentication** due to backend JWT filter issue with `/api/user/me` endpoint.

üìñ **Read full documentation**: [VAN_DE_DANG_NHAP_VA_GIAI_PHAP.md](./VAN_DE_DANG_NHAP_VA_GIAI_PHAP.md) (Vietnamese)

**Quick Summary**:
- ‚úÖ Login works and returns JWT token
- ‚ùå `/api/user/me` returns 401 (backend filter issue)
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Using `AuthContextMock` to bypass the `/api/user/me` call
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You still need **real credentials** from the backend database to login

**To switch back to real auth** (when backend is fixed):
1. Edit `app/_layout.tsx` line 3
2. Change: `import { AuthProvider } from "@/contexts/AuthContextMock";`
3. To: `import { AuthProvider } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";`

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
